# Pug-or-Ugh-API
This is a website to help pet owners find the dog of their dreams. The front end of the site will be connected to the database through the Django REST Framework with proper serialization and models.

This website was built in part with HTML, CSS, and Angular originally supplied from www.teamtreehouse.com for a Python Web Development Tech Degree Project.
The HTML, CSS and React is to be considered built by teamtreehouse for this project, but may be edited by me at some point.
